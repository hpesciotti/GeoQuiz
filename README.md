## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to Felipe Giubilei Photography, the website of a Brazilian audiovisual professional with a diverse portfolio comprising a plethora of photoshoots, from family pictures and renowned rock bands to journalistic images of demonstrations and independent short films. The website is designed as an online portfolio showcasing Felipe's artistic creations and aims to attract potential clients who value a skilled and versatile photographer by displaying his work.  

On a personal note, in the search for the ideal theme to build my first website, part of PP1, I was still deciding the object of this task. Starting from an actual premise for my first project is more manageable than creating a fictional business. 

Therefore, I thought about the work of my dear cousin Felipe Giubilei, an accomplished photographer. To my surprise, his work needs a landing page. Thus, besides having a solid theme for my PP1 with excellent visual appeal given by his photos, I can soon grace him with a fully functional website.

## **2. UX Design**

### **2.1. Strategy**

While researching other photographers' websites, I noticed they were very minimalistic in design, with few text sections and mainly focusing on the photos. The artistic appeal was high, but the page layout structure was sometimes unorthodox. Another thing I noticed is that, in general, there are two types of photographer websites: some more artistic, which belong to award-winning professionals, and the more user friendly ones, with more recognizable sections, sucha as contact details, which belong to freelance professionals specialized in wedding photoshoots. 

I intended to blend those styles, striking a balance between something artistic but also accessible and luring possible clients. I am also looking for a familiar design for the website, and I concluded that we usually connect with photography through Instagram or Flickr. Considering my coding limitations, I looked for design and layout trademarks from those companies to implement on my website.

Some of the photographer's pages I researched were selected by [Webcitz](https://www.webcitz.com/blog/50-best-photographer-websites/) as the best 50 photographers websites.

### **2.2. User Stories**

#### **First Time Visitor Goals**
-   I want to acquaint myself with the photographer's portfolio.
-   I want to understand the types of photoshoots the photographer can undertake.
-   I want to quickly find what I'm looking for, without extensive reading or following numerous links.

#### **Returning Visitor Goals**
-   I want to learn about the photographer's qualifications.
-   I want to discover how to contact the photographer.
-   I want to easily find social media links.

#### **Frequent User Goals**
-   I want to book a session with the photographer.
-   I want to see new additions to the portfolio.

### **2.3. Wireframes**

I created the initial website wireframes in MS PowerPoint, which I was most familiar with. At this stage in the project development, I hadn't decided on the colour scheme yet, so I experimented with the design and layout of the main pages/features.

### **2.4. Design**

#### **Imagery**

I used authorial photos, so I had to select images from the photographer's portfolio. As selecting criteria, I wanted images to elucidate his capabilities and versatility. I ended up grouping the pictures into six types, which subsequently became the sections inside the gallery page, those are: 
-   Concerts,
-   Family Moments,
-   Solo Photoshoots,
-   Institutional Events,
-   Urban Photography, and,
-   Weddings.

[Back to top](https://github.com/hpesciotti/GeoQuiz?tab=readme-ov-file#geoquiz--a-geography-quiz-for-all-ages-and-backgrounds)

#### **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme is inspired by tones of violet, indigo, and spotlights, as seen in the selected pictures. This theme is currently popular in software development, and it can be seen in the Microsoft 365 icon, Microsoft Clipchamp and [ESRI Ireland's website](https://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/homehttps://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/home), which heavily weighted on the chosen appearance of my website's nav bar. The colour scheme also matches the background hues of the [hero-image](docs/documentation/hero-image.png).

![Colour Scheme](docs/documentation/colour-scheme.png)

The selection of text and background took into consideration the contrast ratio of at least Level AA. [EightShape contrast grid](docs/documentation/contrast-grid.png) is present in the documentation. 

[Back to top](https://github.com/hpesciotti/GeoQuiz?tab=readme-ov-file#geoquiz--a-geography-quiz-for-all-ages-and-backgrounds)

#### **Typography**

I employed three different fonts for the website design. The logo features the Bauhaus 93 font, which is not included in the style.css file as it was utilized in another software to create the logo image. The other two fonts, Inter and Rubik, are sourced from Google Fonts. Rubik font is applied to the navigation bar, while Inter is used in the rest of the website's sections, such as textual elements.

## **3. Features**

### **3.1. Existing Features**

#### **Index/Home Page**

##### **Navigation Bar**

![Nav Bar](docs/documentation/nav-bar-desktop-tablet.png)

- The navigation bar features links that allow users to scroll smoothly to any main page sections.

- The mobile version substitutes the links for a toggle menu indicated by stacked bars. The link area is available through a dropdown menu. 
I accomplished this design based on the Love Running Project.

![Nav Bar](docs/documentation/nav-bar-mobile.png)

![Toggle Menu](docs/documentation/drop-down-menu-mobile.png)

- A hover effect [transform scale](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.php) was added on the link anchors for the desktop version. This feature was suggested by a friend, Bruno Dias. I was using a transform font-size effect in early iterations.

![Hover transform](docs/documentation/hover-transform.png)

- The navigation bar's background has a degradé effect that changes from a three-colour gradient on the desktop/tablet version to a two-colour gradient on the mobile version. This choice was simply made by aesthetics. I drew inspiration from a degradé background from [ESRI Ireland's website](https://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/homehttps://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/home). The background css querry was obtainded through [CSS Gradient's website](https://cssgradient.io/).

##### **Hero Section**

![Hero Section](docs/documentation/hero-image.png)

- The Hero Section of my website occupies the full width of the screen and is located at the top of the index page. I intended to capture the visitor's attention with a captivating picture that would also match the website's colour scheme. 

- The Hero Section is responsive and maintains the shirtless man dancing at the centre of the page in all size versions of the website. 

![Hero Section Mobile and Tablet](docs/documentation/hero-image-mobile-tablet.png)

- This feature wasn't planned when the wireframes were created, but the spacing and lack of an eye-catching element drove me to add the current Hero Section. I took inspiration for this feature from the Love Running Project.

- There's also a "call to action" box that quickly informs the user of the website's main goal. This element was a source of a couple of errors due to its responsivity. The box was bleeding the Hero Section on smaller screens, which prompted me to change the hero image to a relative measure. In this case, I've used "em" unit for the length of the hero image.

#### **Error 404 Page**

This is a conventional 404 error page, with text explaining that a link is missing. I designed the page with a button to return to the index page; in fact, the button is just an anchor element. This customized page replaces the standard GitHub page.

![Error 404](docs/documentation/error-404.png)

[Back to top](https://github.com/hpesciotti/GeoQuiz?tab=readme-ov-file#geoquiz--a-geography-quiz-for-all-ages-and-backgrounds)

### **3.2. Future Features**

- I intend to add a fully functional form that is able to store messages on a server.

- To employ numbered pages on the gallery-themed pages to improve performance.

- A functionality that could enlarge the selected picture on the gallery to full page.

- An option to acquire/download the website photos.

## **5. Testing**

- Daily testing during the code stage was conducted through Google Chrome's DevTools. 

- Moreover, futher testing was executed through real-world devices, laptopts (Windows) and Apple Mobiles (Iphone 12 mini, Iphone X, Iphone 14). 
The browsers used were:  
    - Chrome (only Desktop)
    - Firefox  
    - Edge (only Desktop)
    - Safari (only Mobile)

### **5.1. Futher Testing**

#### **HTML Validation using W3C Validation** 

All of the pages are valid, showing no errors or warnings, except for the contact page.
The error was diagnosed as bad value URL attribute method on element form.
I opted to change the post method redirecting to Code Institute dump page to a URL method, as my mentor and cohort facilitator indicated.

#### **Performance Lighthouse**

I have received relatively low-performance ratings from Google Chrome Lighthouse-DevTools. Although I thoroughly compact the images and convert them to WebP, the scores on some pages, notably the gallery pictures, are sometimes lower than 80. I asked my mentor([mine](docs/documentation/lighthouse-gallery-familly-desktop.png), [his](docs/documentation/lighthouse-mentor.png)) and a friend([mine](docs/documentation/lighthouse-index-desktop.png), [his](docs/documentation/lighthouse-friend.png)) to check the performance of some random pages, and they got good results. My internet connection was unstable during the tests.

### **5.3. Unsolved Bugs** 

- There is a thin white line at the bottom of the desktop version. This bug is due to the transfrom hover font-size in the social media icons. The transform scale effect doesn't work on Font-Awesome icons, so I opt to maintain the hover effect, regardless of the white bottom line.

![thin white line](error-persistent-1-footer-white-line)

- Another error, already mentioned before, was diagnosed by the W3C validator as a bad value URL attribute method on the element form on the contact page.

### **6.1. GitHub Pages**

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

I. Log in to GitHub.
II. Navigate to the main page of GitHub Repository that will be deployed.
III. At the top of the Repository, find the "Settings" button on the menu and click on it.
IV. Inside the settings, on the left side of the page, there’s a list of tab menu. Find the “Pages” tab, and click on it.
V. Under "Source", click on the dropdown item called "None", select "Master", and then click on the “Save” button.
VI. The page will automatically refresh.
VII. Now you should see a notification message that provides the now published site link: “Your site is ready to be published at [https://hpesciotti.github.io/FGiubilei/](https://hpesciotti.github.io/FGiubilei/)”.

[Back to top](https://github.com/hpesciotti/GeoQuiz?tab=readme-ov-file#geoquiz--a-geography-quiz-for-all-ages-and-backgrounds)

### **6.2. Forking the GitHub Repository**

By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account. You can view and/or make changes to this copy, without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:

I. Log in to GitHub.
II. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.
III. At the top right of the Repository, just below your profile picture, find the "Fork" button.
IV. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
V. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.

[Back to top](https://github.com/hpesciotti/GeoQuiz?tab=readme-ov-file#geoquiz--a-geography-quiz-for-all-ages-and-backgrounds)

### **6.3. Making a Local Clone**

By cloning a GitHub Repository, you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. This allows you to make all of your edits locally, rather than directly in the source files of the origin repository, by using the following steps:

I. Log in to GitHub
II. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.
III. Above the list of files, click on the dropdown item called "Code".
IV. To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under "HTTPS".
V. Open Git Bash.
VI. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

Changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have a write access for the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.

[Click Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for a more comprehensive guide on how to complete the above process.
